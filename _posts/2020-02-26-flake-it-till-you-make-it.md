title: The Challenges
subtitle: 

---

Are you pursuing an undergraduate degree in life science, recently learned about bioinformatics and want to learn it by yourself?
Or are you a researcher, and want to equip yourself with computational tools to aid your research?

Not being from a technical background seems to be a huge hurdle for the learning of bioinformatics.
Isn't it?
Just making yourself comfortable to even start learning the computational tools or to write a program all by yourself can seem to be a challenging task. 
It's normal to feel overwhelmed.
There could be multiple reasons to feel this way.
Some may include fear of programming or fear of failure, or not knowing from where to start.
No matter what your reason may be, one thing you should know is that it's okay to not know things.
It's totally fine to reach out to people and ask even the most basic question that was bothering you.
