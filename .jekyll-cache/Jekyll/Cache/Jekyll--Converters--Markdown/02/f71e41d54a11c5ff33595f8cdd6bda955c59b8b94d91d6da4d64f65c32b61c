I"é<p>Ankit Kumar is a senior software developer and has completed his bachelorâ€™s degree in technology from NIT Durgapur. He has a major interest in bioinformatics and computational biology. He has been kind enough to share some of the major challenges he faced while learning bioinformatics.</p>

<p>I was introduced to bioinformatics during my 6th semester. And now I am considering bioinformatics as my career choice.</p>

<p>The major challenges I faced were:</p>

<h2 id="1-unable-to-find-an-open-source-alternative-to-paid-softwaretools">1. Unable to find an open-source alternative to paid software/tools.</h2>

<p>For example, pymol is open source but we donâ€™t have a permissive license.</p>

<p>If you have also faced such a problem you can refer to the list below. 
This is the list of few free and open-source tools available.</p>

<h2 id="3-unable-to-find-concise-information-about-the-working-of-the-tools">3. Unable to find concise information about the working of the tools.</h2>

<p>For example in the case of clustal omega, the information regarding the working is available but it is difficult to understand for a beginner.</p>

<p>Here are some examples from which you can learn about the functioning of some tools of bioinformatics.</p>
